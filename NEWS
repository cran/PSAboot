Version 1.0.1

* The summary function now includes a weighted pooled estimate. This estimate is weighted using the inverse balance estimates so that boostrap samples with better balance are weighted more to the estimate than those with worse balance.
* You can now specify how the balance estimates are aggregated. Possible values include mean (the default), q25, q75, median, or max.
* Added getPSAbootMethods and global R option "PSAboot.methods" that will return the default set of functions to use in PSAboot.
* Added a number of parameters to the boxplot function including a tufte style from the ggthemes package.

Version 1.0

* Initial version of PSAboot package for bootstrapping propensity score analysis.
